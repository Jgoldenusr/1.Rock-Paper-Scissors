## About the project

This page was made for the "Rock Paper Scissors" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

The game was meant to showcase the flexbox and CSS styling skills learned so far.

The page is fully responsive and was built using CSS for styling, HTML for structure and Javascript for the scripts.

You can test the demo [here.](https://jgoldenusr.github.io/1.Rock-Paper-Scissors/)
